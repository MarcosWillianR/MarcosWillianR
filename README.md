    Hey there! I'm <strong>Marcos</strong>, a Fullstack Developer from Brazil, currently working at <strong>GanheJunto</strong>. I specialize in Web and Mobile development using React and React Native, and I also work with Python for automations.

    My daily work includes maintaining and evolving existing projects, fixing bugs in production, developing new features, and supporting junior developers. Over time, I've also expanded my skills to backend development with .NET Core (C#), Python scripting, and even native Kotlin for Android POS and totem devices.
    <br/><br/>
    I'm constantly looking to grow â€” currently improving my English with Cambly and diving deeper into advanced React patterns, clean architecture, and scalable code practices. Outside of code, I enjoy reading, gaming, and spending quality time with my family.
